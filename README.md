## Project Overview  
The **Smart Laundry Management System** is a web-based application designed to optimize the management of shared laundry facilities in dormitories, apartment complexes, and laundromats. It provides real-time machine monitoring, a reservation system, integrated payments, and penalties for delayed laundry removal to ensure a seamless laundry experience.  

## Features  
### 1. **User Authentication**

- Users can check the status of machines in real time  
- Displays remaining time for each laundry cycle  

### 3. **Reservation System**  
- Allows users to reserve machines in advance  
- Prevents machine hogging and reduces wait times  

### 4. **Payment Integration**  
- Users can enter their credit card details for automatic payments  

### 5. **Penalty System for Delays**  
- Charges users if they do not remove clothes promptly after a cycle ends  
- Helps improve machine availability and efficiency   

## Tech Stack
